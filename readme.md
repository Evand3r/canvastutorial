# Canvas tutorial

This repo has several projects that use the HTML [canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) just to teach myself a different aspect of proramming than what I'm used to.

So far I've been using the following material:
 - [The HTML5 Canvas Handbook](http://bucephalus.org/text/CanvasHandbook/) is a great reference for all the whole features of the 2d context API.
 - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API#guides_and_tutorials) list of canvas guides and tutorials
